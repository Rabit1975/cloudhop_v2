I have successfully implemented **Galaxy Growth Events**, the ceremonial expansion of the universe.

### 1. **Created `GalaxyGrowthEngine.ts`**
I built the engine that detects rare cosmic milestones:
- **File**: [GalaxyGrowthEngine.ts](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/engine/GalaxyGrowthEngine.ts)
- **Logic**: Triggers growth when the galaxy reaches high resonance, low turbulence, and advanced evolution.
- **Events**: Generates seasonal events like "Bloom Expansion" or "Surge Ascension".

### 2. **Created Visuals & UI**
I implemented the ceremonial layer for these moments:
- **`GalaxyGrowthEvent.tsx`**: A galaxy-wide pulse and glyph burst that ripples through the starfield.
- **`GalaxyGrowthBanner.tsx`**: A ceremonial notification announcing the expansion event.

### 3. **Integrated into Evolution Context**
I wired the growth engine into `GalaxyEvolutionContext`.
- **File**: [GalaxyEvolutionContext.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/context/GalaxyEvolutionContext.tsx)
- **Behavior**: Periodically checks for growth conditions and spawns events, creating rare, impactful moments in the simulation.

### 4. **Wired into Galaxy View**
I updated `Layout.tsx` to render these massive events.
- **File**: [Layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/ui/layout/Layout.tsx)
- **Result**: The galaxy view now supports three layers of activity:
    1. **Constant**: Drifting starfield and constellations.
    2. **Reactive**: Constellation storms and seasonal shifts.
    3. **Ceremonial**: Rare growth events that reshape the cosmos.

CloudHop's universe is now complete: a living, breathing, evolving emotional ecosystem.
