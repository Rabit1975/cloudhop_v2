I have successfully integrated the **GalaxyHomeScreen**, creating the unified emotional cosmos of CloudHop.

### 1. **Created `GalaxyHomeScreen.tsx`**
I built the master interface that weaves together every emotional system:
- **File**: [GalaxyHomeScreen.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/screens/GalaxyHomeScreen.tsx)
- **Features**:
    - **Living Map**: Displays the drifting starfield, pulsing constellations, and orbit lines.
    - **Reactive Weather**: Renders seasonal atmospheres and constellation storms.
    - **Ceremonial Events**: Flashes galaxy growth pulses and shift banners.
    - **HUD & Panels**: Includes the Galaxy HUD on hover, a slide-up Evolution Panel, and the integrated Emotional Dashboard.

### 2. **Integrated into Layout**
I replaced the inline Galaxy View code in `Layout.tsx` with this new, modular screen.
- **File**: [Layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/ui/layout/Layout.tsx)
- **Result**: The "Hop Spaces" (Galaxy) view is now the fully realized home of the emotional OS.

CloudHop has transformed from a set of components into a living, breathing universe. The galaxy evolves, storms, blooms, and drifts on its own, offering a mythic interface for digital life.
