### Embedding with Channel Name
Embed a Twitch stream by providing the channel name. This is the most straightforward way to display a live broadcast.

```tsx
<TwitchViewer channelName="twitch" />
```
### Embedding with Stream URL
Embed a Twitch stream by providing the full stream URL. The component automatically extracts the channel name from the URL.
```tsx
<TwitchViewer twitchStreamUrl="https://www.twitch.tv/rocketleague" />
```
### Muted Autoplay Stream
Control the initial playback state of the embedded stream. The stream will automatically start playing but remain muted until the user interacts.
```tsx
<TwitchViewer channelName="riotgames" autoplay={true} muted={true} />
