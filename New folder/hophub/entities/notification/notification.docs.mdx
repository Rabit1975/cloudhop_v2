A data entity representing a HopHub notification, including details such as its type, message, and read status. This component supports serialization and de-serialization of notification objects.

### Creating a new notification

Demonstrates how to create a notification instance from a plain object. This is useful when receiving data from an API or another service.

```ts
import { Notification } from './notification.js';
const plainNotification = {
  id: 'noti-001',
  userId: 'user-abc',
  type: 'new_message',
  message: 'You have a new message from John Doe.',
  link: '/messages/john-doe',
  read: false,
  timestamp: '2023-10-27T14:30:00Z',
};
const notification = Notification.from(plainNotification);
console.log(notification.message);
```

### Serializing a notification to an object
Shows how to convert a notification instance back into a plain JavaScript object. This is useful for sending notification data to an API or storing it.
```ts
import { Notification } from './notification.js';
const notification = new Notification(
  'noti-002',
  'user-xyz',
  'channel_invite',
  'You were invited to #general-chat.',
  false,
  '2023-10-27T15:00:00Z',
  '/channels/general-chat'
);
const plainObject = notification.toObject();
console.log(plainObject.type);
```

### Generating mock notifications
Illustrates how to generate multiple mock notification instances for development or testing purposes. This provides convenient dummy data.
```ts
import { mockNotifications } from './notification.mock.js';
const notifications = mockNotifications();
notifications.forEach((noti) => console.log(`${noti.id}: ${noti.message}`));
