An Audio Upload Input component to facilitate the selection and uploading of audio files. It provides a drag-and-drop area, file metadata input, and visual feedback for the upload process.


### Basic Audio Upload

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Audio Upload Input component. Users can click to select a file or drag and drop an audio file into the designated area. Once a file is selected, they can add a title and artist before initiating the upload.

```jsx
<AudioUploadInput
  onUpload={(data) => console.log('Upload initiated', data)}
/>
```

### Upload with Progress and Loading State

This example shows how to integrate upload progress and a loading state into the component. The `isUploading` prop disables interactions during the upload, and the `uploadProgress` prop updates the progress bar, giving users visual feedback.

```jsx
() => {
  const [progress, setProgress] = React.useState(0);
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = React.useState(false);
  const handleUpload = (data) => {
    setIsUploading(true);
    setProgress(0);
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setProgress((prev) => {
        if (prev >= 100) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          setIsUploading(false);
          return 100;
        }
        return prev + 10;
      });
    }, 200); // Simulate upload progress
    console.log('Simulated upload of', data);
  };
  return (
    <AudioUploadInput
      onUpload={handleUpload}
      isUploading={isUploading}
      uploadProgress={progress}
    />
  );
}
```

### Displaying an Error Message

This example illustrates how to show an error message to the user. The `error` prop accepts a string which will be displayed prominently if there is an issue with the upload or file selection.

```jsx
<AudioUploadInput
  onUpload={(data) => console.log(data)}
  error="File type not supported or file is too large. Please try again."
/>
