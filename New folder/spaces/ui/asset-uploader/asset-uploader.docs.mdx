A dedicated component for uploading and managing assets within a given space or content context. It provides a user-friendly drag and drop interface or a file input button. Uploaded assets are displayed using `asset-preview` components, and the system shows upload progress with loading spinners. It integrates with `useAssets` hooks for comprehensive asset handling including uploads and deletions.

### Basic Asset Uploader

A basic implementation of the AssetUploader component for a given space ID. This example demonstrates the core functionality for file uploads.

```tsx
<BasicUploader />
```
### Asset Uploader with Preloaded Assets
Display the AssetUploader with a set of existing assets and associate them with a specific content ID. This shows how to manage assets already linked to a piece of content.
```tsx
<WithPreloadedAssets />
```
### Nebula Themed Asset Uploader

```tsx
<NebulaThemedUploader />
