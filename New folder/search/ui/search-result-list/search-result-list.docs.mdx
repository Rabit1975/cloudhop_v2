A `SearchResultList` component displays a collection of search results using `SearchResultCard` components. It handles states for loading and when no results are found.

### Basic list of results

This example demonstrates how to render a basic list of search results.

```tsx
<SearchResultList results={[
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'HopHub General',
    description: 'The main gathering place for the CloudHop community. Join the conversation and connect with others.',
    type: 'Channel',
    imageUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-generated-images/images/image_a_futuristic_and_abstract_digi_0_1770835145692.png',
    link: '/channels/general',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    title: 'Cyber Nebula RPG',
    description: 'An immersive RPG experience available now on GameHub. Explore the vast digital universe.',
    type: 'Game',
    imageUrl: 'https://storage.googleapis.com/bit-generated-images/images/image_a_futuristic_and_abstract_digi_0_1770835145692.png',
    link: '/gamehub/cyber-nebula',
  },
]} />
```
### Loading state
This example shows the loading state of the component while search results are being fetched.
```tsx
<SearchResultList loading />
```
### No results found
This example illustrates the display when no search results are returned.
```tsx
<SearchResultList results={[]} emptyMessage="No channels or games found. Try a different search term." />
