I have successfully ascended the **SeasonWheel** to its mythic form.

### 1. **Updated `SeasonWheel.tsx` (Ascended Edition)**
I replaced the static implementation with the GPU-accelerated, motion-rich version:
- **File**: [SeasonWheel.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/components/SeasonWheel.tsx)
- **Ascended Features**:
    - **Rotational Drift**: The entire ring rotates based on the emotional `drift` vector.
    - **Resonance Pulse**: The core breathes in sync with the field's coherence.
    - **Turbulence Shimmer**: A dynamic, misty layer that reacts to emotional chaos.
    - **Active Season Glow**: The current season glyph scales up and glows with mythic intensity.

### 2. **Updated Layout Demo**
I updated the sidebar demo to feed the new resonance and turbulence data into the wheel.
- **File**: [Layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/ui/layout/Layout.tsx)
- **Demo Props**:
    - `resonance={0.7}` (Strong coherence)
    - `turbulence={0.2}` (Low chaos)

The **SeasonWheel** now spins with the same life-force as the other artifacts, completing the ascended UI suite.
