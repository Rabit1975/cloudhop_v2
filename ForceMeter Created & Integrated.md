I have successfully created and integrated the **ForceMeter**, completing the emotional instrumentation suite.

### 1. **Created `ForceMeter.tsx`**
I created the component with the mythic energy conduit visualization:
- **File**: [ForceMeter.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/components/ForceMeter.tsx)
- **Features**:
    - **Rising Energy Bar**: Tracks the force strength (0-1).
    - **Background Shimmer**: A blurred, shifting gradient representing potential energy.
    - **Pulsing Glyph**: The force symbol beats with resonance.
    - **Resonance Halo**: A glowing shadow that expands with field coherence.

### 2. **Wired into Layout (Demo)**
I added the `ForceMeter` to the sidebar demo stack, below the CycleRibbon.
- **File**: [Layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/ui/layout/Layout.tsx)
- **Demo Props**:
    - `strength={0.65}` (Strong surge)
    - `resonance={0.4}` (Moderate coherence)
    - `turbulence={0.2}` (Low chaos)
    - `force` set to "Surge" (Orange/Electric)

All emotional artifacts are now fully operational in the demo shell.
