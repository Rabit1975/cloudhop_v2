Create a high-resolution cosmic emblem for a HopSpace called **${name}**.
The Space type is **${type}**, and the emotional mood is **${mood}**.

Style the emblem as a glowing celestial body — a planet, star, or nebula — 
with swirling colors and textures that reflect the mood. 
Use vibrant neon lighting, soft atmospheric glow, and subtle cosmic details 
(star particles, orbit rings, energy flares).

The design should feel alive, expressive, and slightly surreal, 
matching a futuristic cosmic OS aesthetic. 
Avoid text, avoid UI elements — this is a pure visual identity symbol.
