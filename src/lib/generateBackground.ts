Generate an abstract cosmic background texture for a HopSpace named **${name}**.
The Space type is **${type}**, and the mood is **${mood}**.

The background should be a flowing nebula or atmospheric gradient 
with soft motion energy, subtle star particles, and layered depth. 
Use colors that match the mood and blend smoothly. 
The style should feel ambient, immersive, and non-distracting — 
perfect as a backdrop for an interactive creative environment.

No text, no symbols, no characters — only atmospheric cosmic texture.
