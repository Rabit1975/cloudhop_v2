A dedicated login page for the CloudHop platform. This component provides a user interface for entering email and password credentials to log into the system. Upon successful authentication, it automatically redirects the user to the dashboard.

### Basic Login Page

This example shows the default appearance of the login page. It includes input fields for email and password, a login button, and a link to sign up.

```tsx
<Login />
```
### Login Page with Dark Theme
This example demonstrates how the login page adapts to a dark theme. The component uses theming variables to ensure its appearance is consistent with the overall application theme.
```tsx
<Login />
```
### Login Page with Authentication Behavior
This example describes the behavior of the login page when authentication occurs. If a user is already authenticated when landing on this page, they are automatically redirected to the root path of the application. After a successful login attempt, the user is also redirected.
```tsx
<Login />
