The Signup component provides a user interface for new users to register an account on the CloudHop platform. It includes fields for display name, email, and password, handles form submission, and redirects authenticated users.

### Basic Signup Form

Displays the core signup form with fields for display name, email, and password.

```tsx
<MockProvider>
  <Signup />
</MockProvider>
```
### Signup with Custom Styling
Applies a custom CSS class to the main container for additional styling.
```tsx
<MockProvider>
  <Signup className="my-custom-signup-class" />
</MockProvider>
```
### Signup in Dark Mode
Renders the signup component within a dark theme context to demonstrate its appearance.
```tsx
<MockProvider noTheme>
  <CloudrabbitTheme initialTheme="dark">
    <Signup />
  </CloudrabbitTheme>
</MockProvider>
