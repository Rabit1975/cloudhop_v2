DESCRIPTION
Worms Zone is a game with a dynamic storyline. Start growing your worm right now. Having tried to get a real anaconda, a small worm never gets stuck in one place – he’s ready to bite everyone. However, there is a danger to be eaten by a more successful player. The Worms are real gourmets. They love trying various gelatinous goodies and everything they meet on their route.

INSTRUCTIONS
Use the mouse to control the worm's direction and space bar to speed up it.
