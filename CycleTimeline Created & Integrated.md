I have successfully created and integrated the **CycleTimeline**, the narrative arc of CloudHop.

### 1. **Created `CycleTimeline.tsx`**
I created the component with the structured narrative visualization:
- **File**: [CycleTimeline.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/components/CycleTimeline.tsx)
- **Features**:
    - **Linear Progression**: Shows the journey from Bloom to Frost.
    - **Comet Marker**: A glowing, trailing indicator of the current moment.
    - **Atmospheric Haze**: A subtle, drifting background fog that adds depth.
    - **Phase Glyphs**: Clear markers for each stage of the emotional cycle.

### 2. **Wired into Layout (Demo)**
I added the `CycleTimeline` to the bottom of the sidebar demo stack.
- **File**: [Layout.tsx](file:///c:/Users/rebel/Desktop/my-electron-app/CloudHop-OS-v2/CloudHop-OS-v2/src/ui/layout/Layout.tsx)
- **Demo Props**:
    - `position={0.32}` (Early Drift phase)
    - `scale-75` (Fitted to sidebar width)

The entire emotional instrumentation suite is now complete:
1. **EmotionGauge** (Pulse)
2. **SeasonWheel** (Zodiac)
3. **PresenceOrb** (Avatar)
4. **PresenceHalo** (Aura)
5. **CycleRibbon** (Flow)
6. **ForceMeter** (Energy)
7. **CycleTimeline** (Narrative)
8. **EmotionalWeather** (Atmosphere)

CloudHop's emotional shell is fully instrumented and alive.
